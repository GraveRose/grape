# grape.sh

## Purpose
By supplying an IP address, this tool will perform passive information gathering on the IP by looking up information from Alienvault, VirusTotal and Shodan. You **must** have your own API key for each of these and place them in the variables at the top of the file.

## Usage

`grape.sh -4 ip.add.re.ss` will collect the information on that IP address and display it to STDOUT for you to review.
